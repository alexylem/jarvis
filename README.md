# Jarvis [![Version-shield]](CHANGELOG.md) [![License-shield]](LICENSE.md)

![Banner]

## ![English][English] English
> Jarvis.sh is a lightweight configurable multi-lang jarvis-like bot.
Meant for home automation running on slow computer (ex: Raspberry Pi 2 & 3).  
It installs automatically speech recognition & synthesis engines of your choice.  
It works with a [plugin store](http://domotiquefacile.fr/jarvis/plugins) to add some cool features.

This project is multilingual, which means that you may receive assistance, at least in French and in English.
